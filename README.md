# DeepScan3D-Single-X-ray-to-3D-CT-Reconstruction-using-Neural-Radiance-Fields-
A NeRF-based framework in PyTorch to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D CT-like volumes  from a single 2D X-ray image. Integrated components include learned latent code representation, differentiable volume rendering using  the Lambert-Beer law, and a GAN training loop with SSIM and reconstruction losses.
